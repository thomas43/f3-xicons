He was only 30 years old, and the son of another member of the Knoxville PAX, Brian Pitstick, aka ""Sparkler"". ""Grady Corn"" is a a combination of Grady's name and ""Candy Corn"", which was an exercise Grady brought to us that became his trademark. It is a shoulder warm up that can become a full-on exercise with enough reps. Here is its description: Four-count exercise that begins in a standing position with your arms together, straight out in front of you. Swing your arms back to a ""T"" formation, then over your head to form a triangle, then back down to a ""T"", and then back to the starting position. 25 reps makes for a good shoulder warm up. At 50 reps the mumblechatter starts to dwindle. Groans of pain begin at about rep 75, which should be taken by the Q as encouragement to keep going to 100."

Green Sally Up,Music,"Q plays the song ""Flower"" by Moby (Gone in 60 seconds soundtrack).

Pax will hold the down position until the next rep. It's only 31 little reps in 3:30. Scale this workout to your fitness level: If you are fatigued, modify the 'mericans by either doing chest to ground at the bottom, or take no shame and use your knees. Here's a tip to complete it, position hands between shoulders and chest and close to the body, much less stress on the shoulders. This can be modified to about any move; squats, curls, planks or even pull-ups if you are absolutely insane. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6A2V9Bu80J4"

One Calls,,"One Calls This is an 8-count IC exercise developed as a result of the sometimes horrible merkin form by some PAX, especially those claiming to do great #ï¿½s when in fact they didnï¿½t do any correctly. It was a way to force the PAX to have FULL extension both at the bottom and the top, which only makes them better (and stops the improper form). Since I work with OneCall and he would come to the office daily to complain about this, I developed this exercise and named it after him for my upcoming Q. Start in Merkin/Plank position. 1 ï¿½ Down; 2 ï¿½ Hand Release; 3 ï¿½ Up and hold; 4 ï¿½ Floyd Mayweather Punch Right arm; 5 ï¿½ Right arm down; 6 ï¿½ Floyd Mayweather Punch Left arm; 7 ï¿½ Left arm down; 8 (which would be the PAX count of 1, 2, 3, etc) ï¿½ Full plank. As you can see, this forces the PAX to go all the way down instead of the 1-2ï¿½ down that some claim count as a merkin, and it forces a locking of the elbows at the top. 10-15 of these are excellent. It has also been done with 2 PAX facing each other and keeping each other honest (Q choice with these to make the Floyd Mayweathers into Booyah Merkins or Slap 5's or anything like that where the PAX are mirroring each other)."

Twin Tower of Trust,Routine,"Twin Tower of Trust Each PAX member will hold a brick in each hand, facing another PAX member (for example, with 20 guys total, 10 line up facing each other about 3-4 feet apart). When the Q calls the exercise, they will hold the bricks straight out at eye level, with no touching of bricks or partners' bricks. The person on the end will bear crawl under everyone holding the bricks (this is where the trust comes in). When they reach the end, they will pick a side and hold their bricks up.

Ultimate Football,Routine,"Ultimate Football Played like Ultimate Frisbee but with a football. The scoring team calls out an exercise for the entire PAX, but the â€œlosingâ€ team has to do double the amount. For example, if the exercise is â€œ10 burpees,â€ the scoring team does 10 burpees, while the losing team does 20 burpees. If one team scores three times in a row, that team has to run a lap around the field in addition to their exercises. Play for an hour, usually around the holidays."
Ultimate Frisburpee,Routine,"Ultimate Frisburpee This game is similar to ultimate frisbee but includes penalty burpees. On the 1st turnover, all PAX do 5 burpees. On the 2nd turnover, it's 4 burpees; on the 3rd, 3 burpees; on the 4th turnover, 2 burpees; and on the 5th turnover, 1 burpee. If neither team has scored, the remainder of the point is played like regular ultimate frisbee. The burpee count resets after each point.

The game is usually played for about 20 minutes and is a favorite in F3 Hampton Roads."

Up Straddle Hop,Legs,"Up Straddle Hop Side Straddle Hops performed using one leg. Itâ€™s suggested to do 25-30 reps on each leg in cadence. I recently tore my calf and have been on injury reserve (IR) for a bit. Not wanting to miss our monthly convergence, I grabbed my kettlebell to use when the PAX were doing exercises I couldnâ€™t participate in and headed out to the beatdown. We circled up, and the first exercise called was SSH. Not wanting to put pressure on my torn calf, I started hopping on one leg in cadence while still doing the upper body motion. Apparently, it looked funny, as the PAX started laughing and then joined in. Forty-three men hopping on one leg and waving their arms would have looked awesome to any passersby! Doing 30 IC of those completely exhausted my right (good) leg, so I figured it might need a name. Let the PAX name it and do 25-30 IC with each leg. It burns! For good measure, the Q next called for 10 OYO burpees. I tried to do them one-legged, and after 2 burpees, I had absolutely no strength left in my good leg. So, doing burpees on one leg could be an interesting add-on to the exercise."
Upper Decker,Legs,Best used with sturdy picnic table or stairs. PAX will step up to the tabletop (two steps) when on top perform one air squat and step down. In reference to the movie MaGruber

The last man (or last 2 men in larger groups) peels off, runs to the pitcher's mound, performs 5 of an exercise, and then rejoins the PAX at the front. Repeat this for all PAX. Change the mode of travel and the exercises accordingly. For example: PAX bear crawl around the bases. The last man moseys to the pitcher's mound for 5 Merkins and then returns to the front of the PAX. Or, PAX lunge walk around the bases. The last man moseys to the pitcher's mound for 5 jump squats and then returns to the front."
Walk Like An Egyptian,Legs|Routine,"Walk Like An Egyptian The PAX line up single-file, about an armâ€™s length apart. In unison, the entire PAX lunges forward with their right leg and holds the lunge, while the last PAX jailbreaks to the front of the line. The entire PAX then recovers and lunges forward with their left leg and holds the lunge, while the last PAX jailbreaks to the front.

Weekend at Bernie's,Full Body,"Weekend at Bernie's This is a partner drag exercise where one partner is a ""causality"" and the other partner has to get him down the field. Any type of drag can be used for this exercise. At warthog we used bear crawls as well drags where the pax drags the causality by the ankles down the field.

Werewolf,Full Body,"Werewolf Start in the downward-facing dog position (high plank), transition to a low plank, then to upward-facing dog, and back to downward-facing dog in one smooth motion. On the return to downward-facing dog, the PAX should push through the shoulders to really feel the burn. It kind of looks like you are going from downward dog to howling at the moon. The first time the Smokehouse men did it, there was a full moon over Batesburg-Leesville."
Whamo lunge walks,Routine,"Whamo lunge walks Named after the toy company Wham-O. One pax throws a frisbee. All pax sprint in that direction until frisbee lands. When it lands, all PAX stop and then lunge-walk until they get to the frisbee. Can be modified with duck walk, crab walk, whatever."

One PAX (the attacker or ""it"") starts in one corner, while all the other PAX start in the opposite corner. Assume the bear crawl position and stay there. The attacker begins to chase the other PAX throughout the kill zone (in bear crawl mode). Once contact is made with a PAX (""tag""), the contacted PAX becomes the new attacker, returns to their corner, and the game starts over. Adjust the exercise based on the size of the kill zone and the number of people. Variation: Instead of tagging, you must take your prey down to the ground (F3 meets jiu-jitsu), which should be safe from your hands and knees."
