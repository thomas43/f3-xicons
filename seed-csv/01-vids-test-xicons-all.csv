"CHARLIE FOXTROT","""Not only are bloggers suckers for the remarkable, so are the people who read blogs
  .â€ - Seth Godin Introduction: If you run a website, chances are you already have a blog. And if you don't, maybe you should start one. A blog can boost your brand awareness, increase conversions, and improve customer service. Blogs help you connect with your audience on a more personal level and allow them to interact with you in an individual capacity. Blogging also helps to present viewers with fresh content regularly. With that said, here are 8 reasons why you should start blogging on your website today! ðŸ'Š 1. Drive traffic to your website With the right blog, you can drive traffic to your site consistently. A blog is also a great way to generate sales. If people visit your blog and sign up for your email newsletter or download a resource that you've put out there, they become potential customers or clients of your business. Blogs are a great way to get people engaged with your brand. 2. Convert traffic into leads Blogging helps your website to be more than just a place for people to visit. It gives them the opportunity to interact with your business in a way that isn't possible through other forms of content on your website. By blogging, you have the ability to help drive traffic back to your website and convert that traffic into leads. For example, if you blog about an important industry event and share it on Facebook and Twitter, you can expect a boost in new signups to your email list or visitors to your website. 3. Become an authority Blogs are a great addition to your site as they give you the ability to create authoritative content. They also help you establish credibility and become an expert in your field. Moreover, they provide you with an opportunity to build an audience that will help push your company's brand recognition. 4. Build relationships with potential customers One of the most important aspects of starting a blog is establishing a connection with your potential customers. This can be done through engaging in conversation on your blog, posting stories about how you operate your business, or even sharing inspiring content that you think will resonate with them. These interactions also make it easier for you to keep up with what people are saying and sharing on social media. 5. You can repurpose blog content for social media This is a great way to get more mileage out of your blogs and increase traffic. However, it's important to use the right type of content on Facebook. If you write about topics like parenting, personal finance, or food, they might not be as relevant on Facebook as other types of posts. If you are looking to make money online, affiliate marketing has become one of the most popular. Affiliate marketing allows bloggers to earn commissions by promoting products and services from others. The blogger does not need to own any product or service to be able to promote them. All he needs is a link to the product or service which he wants to promote. 6. It drives long-term results A blog is an essential tool for building a long-term relationship with your audience. The best blogs will eventually become an extension of your company's culture and marketing strategy, which means that each article you publish has the potential to create a lasting impact on your brand. Your blog serves as a platform through which you can share information, knowledge, and tips on your preferred topics. This allows you to provide valuable content with value in return. The more time readers spend on your website, the more chances there are for them to get familiarized with your business and become customers down the line. 7. Blogging helps with link building Your blog should be the top source of information for your business. By writing consistently on your blog, you'll want to build links back to your website and help increase its authority. You can use a free service like Google Analytics to track how many people are visiting your site. This will give you an idea of what kind of traffic is coming in from where. You can then decide whether or not it makes sense to invest money into advertising. If you have a blog that has been around for a while, you may find yourself having trouble getting new readers. If this is the case, there are many things you can do to get more traffic to your site. You need to make sure that you are providing value in some way to your audience. This means that you should be offering something of interest and benefit to them. You will also want to provide quality content on a regular basis. Make sure you have an RSS feed so that people can subscribe to your blog. This will allow them to receive updates whenever you post new articles. 8. It increases SEO Search engine optimization is a vital part of any successful digital marketing campaign. A well-written blog can improve your search rankings by helping you rank higher in search engines. When someone searches for a topic related to your niche, they will often click on the first few pages of results. These are usually the websites that have the most relevant content. If you want to get more traffic from Google and other search engines, make sure you use keywords throughout your site. This means using them in titles, headers, subtitles, and even in the body of your articles. If you do this, it will help people find what they're looking for when they type in a keyword or phrase into their browser. This means that regardless of what your business offers, your target audience is likely searching for products or services like yours on search engines like Google. Other resources to help you get started with blogging Start your own blog checklist: Here is a quick checklist to get you started with you website blow. Remember imperfect action beats inaction, get started and keep publishing.

"One Calls","One Calls This is an 8-count IC exercise developed as a result of the sometimes horrible merkin form by some PAX, especially those claiming to do great #s when in fact they didnt do any correctly. It was a way to force the PAX to have FULL extension both at the bottom and the top, which only makes them better (and stops the improper form). Since I work with OneCall and he would come to the office daily to complain about this, I developed this exercise and named it after him for my upcoming Q. Start in Merkin/Plank position. 1  Down; 2  Hand Release; 3  Up and hold; 4  Floyd Mayweather Punch Right arm; 5  Right arm down; 6  Floyd Mayweather Punch Left arm; 7  Left arm down; 8 (which would be the PAX count of 1, 2, 3, etc)  Full plank. As you can see, this forces the PAX to go all the way down instead of the 1-2 down that some claim count as a merkin, and it forces a locking of the elbows at the top. 10-15 of these are excellent. It has also been done with 2 PAX facing each other and keeping each other honest (Q choice with these to make the Floyd Mayweathers into Booyah Merkins or Slap 5's or anything like that where the PAX are mirroring each other).","","",exicon,,,

"Ultimate Football","Ultimate Football Played like Ultimate Frisbee but with a football. The scoring team calls out an exercise for the entire PAX, but the ""losingâ€ team has to do double the amount. For example, if the exercise is ""10 burpees,â€ the scoring team does 10 burpees, while the losing team does 20 burpees. If one team scores three times in a row, that team has to run a lap around the field in addition to their exercises. Play for an hour, usually around the holidays.","","Routine",exicon,,,

On the 2nd turnover, it's 4 burpees; on the 3rd, 3 burpees; on the 4th turnover, 2 burpees; and on the 5th turnover, 1 burpee. If neither team has scored, the remainder of the point is played like regular ultimate frisbee. The burpee count resets after each point. You do not have to wait for all PAX to finish their burpees before beginning play (i.e., it is advantageous to finish your burpees quickly).

"Up Straddle Hop","Up Straddle Hop Side Straddle Hops performed using one leg. It's suggested to do 25-30 reps on each leg in cadence. I recently tore my calf and have been on injury reserve (IR) for a bit. Not wanting to miss our monthly convergence, I grabbed my kettlebell to use when the PAX were doing exercises I couldn't participate in and headed out to the beatdown. We circled up, and the first exercise called was SSH. Not wanting to put pressure on my torn calf, I started hopping on one leg in cadence while still doing the upper body motion. Apparently, it looked funny, as the PAX started laughing and then joined in. Forty-three men hopping on one leg and waving their arms would have looked awesome to any passersby! Doing 30 IC of those completely exhausted my right (good) leg, so I figured it might need a name. Let the PAX name it and do 25-30 IC with each leg. It burns! For good measure, the Q next called for 10 OYO burpees. I tried to do them one-legged, and after 2 burpees, I had absolutely no strength left in my good leg. So, doing burpees on one leg could be an interesting add-on to the exercise.","","Legs",exicon,,,
